**Global requirements:**
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Scipy
- tqdm
- pickle

We also used the [`pyMMF`](github.com/wavefrontshaping/pymmf) package to find the modes of the fiber. 
For consistancy, we used a local version of the package, which is included in the repository.

## /Data

Contain the data used in the paper. 
It corresponds to a subset of the large raw data files (hence the `_small` prefix) that are available on request. 
It also contain the processed data, generated by  `Experiment_VS_Model.ipynb`, used to produce the figures of the paper.
The data is organized in folders, each one corresponding to a different fiber. 

- `param_small.pkl` is a pickle file containing a dictionnary of the numerous experimental and numerical parameters.

- `Ys_focus_small.npy` contains the data corresponding to the rotated focus experiment (Fig.1b in the paper). 
We learn to focus on one point and rotate the input wavefront. The output intensity pattern is then recorded for various angles.
The experiment is repeated for different values of the local deformation applied.

## /common

- `functions.py` contain the common functions used in the notebooks for data processing and vizualisation.

## /Validation_and_tests

- `Validation_and_tests.ipynb` contains the code to reproduce the validation and tests on the RME correlation presented in the paper as shown in Fig.1, Fig.2, Fig.5, and Fig.6. 
We present the results of the focusing and field correlation estimation, and compare the latter to the intensity correlation measurement and the numerical estimation using the TM. 

## /Experiment_VS_Model

- `Experiment_VS_Model.ipynb` contains the main results to 1/ fit the theoretical mode (Eq.4) to the experimental data and 2/ to compare the experimental, thoery, and numerical results. 
Corresponds to Fig.3 and Fig.7 in the paper.

- `Show_results.ipynb` contains the code to reproduce the figures of the paper without the need to recompute. 
Used the processed data from `/Data/<FIBER>/processed_data.pkl` generated by `Experiment_VS_Model.ipynb`.

## /RME_operators

- `RME_operator.ipynb` contains the code to reproduce the results regarding the use of RME operators (Eq. 10 and Fig.4 in the paper). 
We experimentally estimated the operators for the different values of the deformation, 
computed the SVD, 
and displayed the corresponding wavefront on the modulator.
We then measured the RME correlation for different singular vectors used.

## /Preprocessing

- `ShrinkData.ipynb` contains the code to generate the smaller data files used in the paper from the raw data files (too big for Github).


## /pyMMF

Version of the [`pyMMF`](github.com/wavefrontshaping/pymmf) package used in the paper.
